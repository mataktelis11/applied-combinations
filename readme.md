# Applied Combinatorics Project - Summer 2021
This project was made for an exam for the lesson Applied Combinatorics, in University of Piraeus IT department. The language used is **Python 3**. A detailed presentation of the algorithms of this repository is provided. You can easily navigate by using the table of contents below.

To better understand the purpose of the code, make sure you are familiar with [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) in general.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- matplotlib
- networkx

## Table of Contents

- [Generating a random undirected graph](./randgraph.md)
- [Finding all the Cliques of an undirected graph with Backtracking](./cliques.md)
- [Estimating the size of the Backtracking Tree](./backtrackingsize.md)
